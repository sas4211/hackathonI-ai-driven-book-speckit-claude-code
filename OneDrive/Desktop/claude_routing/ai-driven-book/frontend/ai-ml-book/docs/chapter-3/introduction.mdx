# Chapter 3: Supervised Learning

## Introduction

Supervised learning is the cornerstone of modern machine learning, powering everything from email spam filters to medical diagnosis systems. This chapter dives deep into algorithms that learn from labeled examples, enabling you to build models that can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

## Chapter Overview

### Learning Objectives
Through hands-on exploration, you'll:
- Master linear and logistic regression fundamentals
- Understand decision trees and their interpretability
- Implement random forests for robust predictions
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Build end-to-end supervised learning projects

### Core Algorithms
**🤖 Algorithms Covered:**
1. **Linear Regression** - Predict continuous outcomes with linear models
2. **Logistic Regression** - Binary and multiclass classification
3. **Decision Trees** - Interpretable tree-based decision making
4. **Random Forests** - Ensemble methods for improved accuracy
5. **Model Evaluation** - Rigorous assessment techniques
6. **Hands-On Project** - Comprehensive supervised learning workflow

## Practical Applications

#### Code Example: Linear Regression from Scratch (Python)
```python
import numpy as np

# Simple dataset
def generate_data(n=20):
    X = np.linspace(0, 10, n)
    noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, n)
    y = 2.5 * X + 4 + noise
    return X, y

X, y = generate_data()

# Closed‑form solution for linear regression
X_b = np.c_[np.ones((len(X), 1)), X]  # add bias term
theta_best = np.linalg.inv(X_b.T @ X_b) @ X_b.T @ y

print("Intercept", theta_best[0])
print("Slope", theta_best[1])
```

#### Table: Regression Evaluation Metrics
| Metric | Description | Typical Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| MSE (Mean Squared Error) | Average squared difference between predicted and actual values | Regression performance |
| RMSE (Root MSE) | Square root of MSE for interpretability in original units | Regression performance |
| R² (Coefficient of Determination) | Proportion of variance explained by the model | Model goodness‑of‑fit |
